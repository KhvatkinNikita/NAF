## NUCL-AI: Sustainable Electrification of Decentralised Regions through Nuclear Microreactors and AI-based Demand Predictions

Welcome to the official repository for **NUCL-AI**, a research project exploring how **AI-powered microreactors** can bring **clean, reliable, and low-cost energy** to remote and decentralised regions across the globe.

## 📄 About the Project

The development of this project begins as part of the I4N Competetion in Spain: Innovatom 2025. The focus this year has been the economic development through nuclear technology. Our approach combined microreactors' capabilities for transportation, as well a the power of predictive models based on Deep Learning for energy demand predictions.

### Contents

- ⚛️ **Modular Nuclear Microreactors** (e.g., Westinghouse’s eVinci)  
- 🤖 **Artificial Intelligence** for predictive energy demand modeling  
- 🏞️ **Decentralized Energy Planning** for hard-to-reach communities  
- 📈 **Economic Viability**, with a case study in Acre, Brazil, showing a payback period of just over 8 years  
- 🌱 A path to **decarbonization**, economic growth, and energy equity
